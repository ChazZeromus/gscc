This is a very early early build of a custom gsc compiler, geared torwards call of duty scripts.
The primary compiling logic is a module, and testcompile.exe is the front end.

What it can do:

-Syntax checking and code graph building (graphs shouldn't concern you)
	The compiler attempts to build a code graph so syntax is checked throughout.

-Semantic checking
	Though not complete yet, will build definition lists and check for coherence
	and symbol existence. Due to the incomplete nature of GSC rips, you cannot
	fully perform semantic checking unless you make your own global stubbings.
	I've attempted to do so with my own and reduced 92K 
-Advanced variable declaration hueristics
	Variable declarations that parrallel in branches can be detected and further
	semantical checking can be performed. This includes only if statements,
	switch blocks. An immediate inline evaluator is required for loops, which
	is partially complete and right now cannot be used.
What it can't do:
	-Compile into executable code of any kind or form
	-Execute the code
	-Check for never-executes
